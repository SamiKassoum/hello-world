# hello-world
getting started with my github account
my name is sami kassoum, 39 years old.
I live in palestine, I code for fun and later maybe for a serius job or freelancing.
I started with the java language becouse I want to be able to build strong apps for android later.
I learn all b myself, but recently I sence the lack of connections with other people who are doing the same as I .
so I am here to learn about github and to join other programmers on whatever projects I found interesting .
best regards, sami
